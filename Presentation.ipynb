    " \n",
    "Grab has been using telematics on accelerometer and gyroscope data from the app to improve safety of their rides\n",
    "\n",
    "In July 2017, the average number of speeding moments was 0.7 per 100km. By July this year, the figure dropped by 64%. Similarly, the average number of harsh braking and heavy acceleration instances per kilometre decreased by 23% and 50% respectively year-on-year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Harsh braking and acceleration are unpleasant for the passenger, and are highly correlated to unsafe behaviours like tailgating, aggressive driving and losing focus on the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "The telematics will be feed into driver awareness and improvements / training programs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grab's Way of Measuring Driving Safety\n",
    "To measure safety, the team at Grab comes out with several descriptive statistics indicative of driving dangerously. Using a machine learning model, these hypothesized features are then validated against data from a set of trips that were flagged by passengers for dangerous driving, and subsequently confirmed as dangerous after investigation by Grab. This step is done to ensure the features can reliably indicate unsafe driver behaviour.\n",

    "### Grander Goal: Safer Everyday Tech Roadmap\n",
    "Safer Everyday Tech Roadmap comprises product enhancements that aim to eliminate preventable incidents, encourage safer user habits and drive long-term changes in road behaviour\n",
    "\n",
    "This includes measures specifically aimed at changing user safety habits – such as driver fatigue monitoring and telematics reports for drivers to learn their driving patterns and identify how to drive more safely – to drive long-term road behaviour change and reduce the chance of incidents.\n",
